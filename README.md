# Things to do

A simple to do list for chrome extensions.

For a video demonstration of my project, [click here](https://youtu.be/ifptNep1Oh8).

## About The Project

The idea for the project came when deciding on my final CS50 project. I have never done a chrome axtension before of even worked with javascript this intuatively. Therefore I decided to challenge myself and try to build a chrome extension that I can actually use.

Since I am on google a lot I decided to make a to do list, since it is basic enough but still challenging enough for myself to actually build it. As I am on the internet a lot a to do list can actually be very helpful since it is just there and there is no need to open a seperate app for windows. Therefore the idea was born.

## Description

The chrome extension - to do list is easy to use. Just add it to your chome extension page and pin if you want and use it as you would any other to do list.

The to do list is quite simple and only made as practice in javascript and chome extension functionality as this is my first project in computer science. Additionally, it is also intended to satisfy the 'final project' requirements for the Harvard CS50 course on [edX.org](https://cs50.harvard.edu//).
## Build using
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [html](https://html.com/)
* [css](https://www.css-com.com/)
* [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Getting Started

### How to install/ usage
* Open google chrome and expand the extension page on the top right.
* Click on the expand extension button, at the bottom.
* Toggle the Developer mode on, top tight of the [chrome://extension](chrome://extension) page.
* Click on the Load unpacked button.
* Select  the folder containing all the files for the extension .
* Once uploaded you can toggle the extension on and pin to the top of the chrome page - top right.
* It will now appear on your chrome page for you to use.


## What can it do
The chrome extension acts as a simple to do list which can be used in your daily life. It can be used to make notes and be used as a checklist.

Features include:

* Adding an item to the todo list.
* Removing and item from the to do list.
* Marking an item as complete.
* And editing an existing item.

All items in the to do list will be saved to your chrome storage and will be there when you chrome again.

## Requiements

Any device that has chrome installed and can accept an extension being added.
