A simple todolist for chrome extensions.

For a video demonstration of my project, [click here]().

## About The Project

The idea for the project came when deciding on my final CS50 project. I have never done a chrome axtension before of even worked with javascript this intuatively. Therefore I decided to challenge myself and try to build a chrome extension that I can actually use.

Since I am on google a lot I decided to make a todo list, since it is basic enough but to challenge myself to actually build it. As i am on the internet a lot a todo list can actually be very helpful cause it is actually just there and no need to open a seperate app for windows. Therefore the idea was born.

## Build using
* [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [html](https://html.com/)
* [css](https://www.css-com.com/)
* [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Getting Started

### How to install/ usage
* Open google chrome and expand the extension page on the top right.
* Click on the expand extension button, at the bottom.
* Toggle the Developer mode on, top tight of the [chrome://extension](chrome://extension) page.
* Click on the Load unpacked button.
* Select  the folder containing all the files for the extension .
* Once uploaded you can toggle the extension on and pin to the top of the chrome page - top right.
* It will now appear on your chrome page for you to use.


## What can it do
The chrome extension acts as a simple todolist which can be used in your daily life. It can be used to make notes and be used as a checklist.

Features include:

* Adding an item to the todo list.
* Removing and item from the todolist.
* Marking an item as complete.
* And editing an existing item.

All items in the todolist will be saved to your chrome storage and will be there when you chrome again.

## Requiements

Any device that has chrome installed and can accept an extension being added.
